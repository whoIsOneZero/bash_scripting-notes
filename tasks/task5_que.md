### Problem 5

Cyberlab has launched the **Cyberlab Lottery Jackpot** game!
Your task is to write a Bash script that simulates this lottery system.

2. Generate **three random winning numbers**.
3. Check if the user's number matches any of the winning numbers:
   - **1st Prize:** If the user's number matches the 1st winning number.
   - **2nd Prize:** If it matches the 2nd winning number.
   - **3rd Prize:** If it matches the 3rd winning number.

5. Use a `case` statement.
